## Installation

Please note that the below instructions were written to work on Windows OS and you may need to adjust the instructions according to the operating system you are using.

### Prerequisites

- Git SCM for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
- Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
- Extension for webui yfszzx/stable-diffusion-webui-inspiration: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Extensions#inspiration

### Steps

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
cd C:/stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/stable-diffusion-webui-inspiration/
git clone https://github.com/hoblin/prompt-master.git
cd prompt-master
docker compose up
```

### Steps explanation

1. [Install Git SCM](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows.
2. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
3. Follow [the instructions](https://github.com/yfszzx/stable-diffusion-webui-inspiration#using-txt2img-inspiration) in the yfszzx/stable-diffusion-webui-inspiration repository to generate previews for the words in the prompts.
4. Open Git Bash and set `git config --global core.autocrlf input` to solve the problem with line endings on Windows.
5. `cd` to the extension directory: `cd C:/stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/stable-diffusion-webui-inspiration/`
6. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hoblin/prompt-master.git`
7. `cd` into the cloned repository: `cd prompt-master`
8. Build and run the Docker container: `docker compose up`
9. Once the Docker container is built, you can use the Docker Desktop app to start, stop, and restart the app.
10. On each start, the app updates to the latest version from Github and scans the inspiration extension directory for new tags previews. To add a new set, generate it in the "inspiration" extension of WebUI and restart the Prompt Master container.

## Usage

Once the app is installed, you can use it by navigating to the app's URL in your web browser http://localhost:8080. Here is a brief overview of the app's main features:

- **Category view**: view all of your prompt sets as image galleries, sorted by name or rating.
  <!-- - **Filter and search**: filter your prompt sets by tags and use a search bar to quickly find specific sets. -->
  <!-- - **Prompt set view**: view a specific prompt set and all the images generated by it. -->
- **Rating and collection**: rate the tags and collect them for further experiments.
- **Tag view**: view tag images, slide between different prompts previews, add to favorites or hide them. Collect tags for further experiments.

<!-- Please refer to the in-app help for detailed information about all of the features and how to use them. -->

<!-- ## Examples

Here are a couple of examples of tasks you can perform using the **Prompt Master** app:

- **View all your prompt sets**: Navigate to the Catalog view in the app to see all of your prompt sets as image galleries, sorted by name or date created.
- **Filter your prompt sets by tag**: Use the filter feature to view only the prompt sets that have a specific tag. For example, you can filter by the tag "landscapes" to see all the prompt sets that have images of landscapes.
- **Collect prompt sets for further experiments**: Use the collection feature to group prompt sets that are similar or have some other characteristics that are interesting to you. -->

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues while using the **Prompt Master** app, please check the following:

- **App doesn't load**: Make sure the Docker container is running and the app's URL is correct.
- **No images in a set**: Make sure that you've generated the images for the prompt set using the inspiration extension in webui.
- **Images are outdated**: Make sure that you've restarted the app after generating images.

If you still experience issues, please file a bug report.
